# Day 22 – Introduction to Git: Your First Repository

## Task

Today marks the beginning of your Git journey. Git is the backbone of modern DevOps — every tool, pipeline, and workflow revolves around version control. Before diving into advanced concepts, you need to get comfortable with the basics by doing.

You will:
- Understand what Git is and why it matters
- Set up your first Git repository from scratch
- Start building a living document of Git commands

---

## Expected Output
- A local Git repository with a clean commit history
- A file called `git-commands.md` that you will keep updating in future days
- A file called `day-22-notes.md` with your answers

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Install and Configure Git
1. Verify Git is installed on your machine

5. Verify your configuration

### Task 2: Create Your Git Project
1. Create a new folder called `devops-git-practice`
2. Initialize it as a Git repository

3. Check the status — read and understand what Git is telling you

   tell it is pointing to master branch, no commits done yet and no files in staging area.

4. Explore the hidden `.git/` directory — look at what's inside

---

### Task 3: Create Your Git Commands Reference
1. Create a file called `git-commands.md` inside the repo
2. Add the Git commands you've used so far, organized by category:
   - **Setup & Config**
   - **Basic Workflow**
   - **Viewing Changes**
3. For each command, write:
   - What it does (1 line)
   - An example of how to use it

---

### Task 4: Stage and Commit
1. Stage your file
2. Check what's staged
3. Commit with a meaningful message
4. View your commit history

---

### Task 5: Make More Changes and Build History
1. Edit `git-commands.md` — add more commands as you discover them
2. Check what changed since your last commit
3. Stage and commit again with a different, descriptive message
4. Repeat this process at least **3 times** so you have multiple commits in your history
5. View the full history in a compact format

---

### Task 6: Understand the Git Workflow
Answer these questions in your own words (add them to a `day-22-notes.md` file):
1. What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?
2. What does the **staging area** do? Why doesn't Git just commit directly?
3. What information does `git log` show you?
4. What is the `.git/` folder and what happens if you delete it?
5. What is the difference between a **working directory**, **staging area**, and **repository**?

---

## Ongoing Task

**Keep updating `git-commands.md` every day** as you learn new Git commands in the upcoming days. This will become your personal Git reference. Maintain a clean commit history — one commit per update with a clear message.

---

## Hints
- All you need today are about 8-10 Git commands — Google them, try them, break things
- Read what `git status` tells you — it's your best friend
- Use `man git-<command>` or `git <command> --help` to explore

---

## Submission
1. Share a screenshot of your `git log --oneline` output showing multiple commits
2. Add your `day-22-notes.md` to `2026/day-22/`
3. Commit and push to your fork
4. Add your submission for Community Builder of the week on discord

---

## Learn in Public

Share your first Git repo and commit history on LinkedIn.
